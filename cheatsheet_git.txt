A Git project has three parts:
1. Working Directory - where files are created, edited, deleted, and organized
2. Staging Area      - where changes that are made to the working directory are listed
3. Repository        - where Git permanently stores changes as different versions of the project

Git workflow: 
1. Edit files in the working directory
2. Add files to the staging area
3. Save changes to a Git repository


Git commands to help keep track of changes made to a project:
git init                       # creates a new Git repository
git status                     # inspects the contents of the working directory and staging area
git add [filename | wildcard]  # adds files from the working directory to the staging area
git diff [filename]            # shows the difference between the working directory and the staging area
git commit -m "Present Tense"  # permanently stores file changes from the staging area in the repository
git log                        # shows a list of all previous commits

git show HEAD                  # show the HEAD (usually the last/top) commit in the log
git checkout HEAD [filename]   # restore [filename] to last (HEAD) commit (undo last changes committed)
                               # basically it discards the changes in your working directory
git reset HEAD [filename | . ] # removes the filename from the staging area
 
git reset [commit_SHA]         # Restores project to the commit indicated by the first 7 chars of its SHA
